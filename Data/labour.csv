Footnotes:
1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality."
2,Excluding the territories.
3,"Industry refers to the general nature of the business carried out by the employer for whom the respondent works (main job only). If the individual did not have a job during the reference week, the data relate to the previous job, if that job was held in the past year. Those unemployed persons who have never worked before and those persons who last worked more than 1 year ago make up the ""unclassified"" category in this table. In January 1999, the industry classification switched from Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 1980) to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which was quite different. For this reason, detailed historical data based on NAICS is provided going back to January 1987. In addition, data from 1976 to 1986 is provided at a less detailed level than the more recent data. Historical data have been created by imputation. From 1976 to 1986, estimates are based on 2002 NAICS. From 1987 onwards, industry estimates are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)."
4,"Number of persons who, during the reference week, worked for pay or profit, or performed unpaid family work or had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason. Those persons on layoff and persons without work but who had a job to start at a definite date in the future are not considered employed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred."
5,"Number of persons who, during the reference week, were without work, had looked for work in the past four weeks, and were available for work. Those persons on layoff or who had a new job to start in four weeks or less are considered unemployed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred."
6,This combines the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11 to 91.
7,This combines the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 11 to 33.
8,This combines the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 41 to 91.
9,"Unemployed persons who have never worked before, and those unemployed persons who last worked more than 1 year ago."
