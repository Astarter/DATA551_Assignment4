The main feedback we received was focused on adding features and other variables to our dashboard to complement the economical analysis. We therefore decided to expand our project from GDP analysis to a full classical macroeconomic analysis to offer insight into the way the economy works and how has Canada’s economy evolved over the years. 

Our analysis now focuses on three aspects: national output (measured by Gross Domestic Product), unemployment, and inflation. To provide detailed information of some of the main aspects of the economy, we conducted an extensive research of the *The Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts* in order to have a conceptually integrated statistical framework for studying the state and behaviour of the Canadian economy. For this purpose, this time we collected values of 6 different datasets from Statistics Canada with information of economic measurements from the year 2000 to 2019 by industry, provinces and territories.  

The datasets collected were all in CSV format, so we used Python and Pandas for the exploratory data analysis. Our data wrangling efforts were mainly put in getting rid of irrelevant values, specifying the correct data types and renaming the columns for ease of interpretation. To summarize and aggregate the information, we also merged 5 datasets together, ending up with 2 data frames and 2 more versions of them with percentage changes values. 

In regards of technologies, we have concluded that when using Dash, it is better to use Python language for programming instead of R, given the resources available online. Also, in terms of visualization, we agreed that Altair provided better features than ggplot, and it was easier to use.  

By completing this project, we now realize the importance of the construct of cognitive load from the user’s perspective of a visualization, the principles of effective dashboard development, design, prototyping and platform evaluation.
