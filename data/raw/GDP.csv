1,Canada totals in the provincial and territorial gross domestic product by income and by expenditure accounts (PTEA) do not correspond to the national gross domestic product by income and by expenditure accounts (IEA) estimates at certain times of the year. The two accounts are brought back in line when annual revisions are incorporated.
