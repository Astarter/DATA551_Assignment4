Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D - Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish or sample size is too small to produce reliable estimates."
2,The introduction of administrative data in 2001 and the associated change in methodology resulted in level shifts for some series. This affects the comparability of pre- and post-2001 estimates.
3,Earnings data are based on gross payroll before source deductions.
4,Industry estimates in this table are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Version 3.0.
5,"Industrial aggregate covers all industrial sectors except those primarily involved in agriculture, fishing and trapping, private household services, religious organisations and the military personnel of the defence services."

10,"Although the creation of Nunavut officially took place in April 1999, the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) was only able to begin publishing separate estimates for Northwest Territories and Nunavut with the release of the January 2001 data. Efforts were undertaken to estimate the employment for Nunavut back to April 1999. These are available upon request by contacting Client Services (toll-free: 1-866-873-8788; statcan.labour-travail.statcan@canada.ca), Labour Statistics Division."
11,"Since January 2001, the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) program no longer combines Northwest Territories and Nunavut. They are produced as two separate territories."
