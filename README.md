## Description

This dashboard shows a geographical heatmap of Canada using colors to demonstrate the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contribution or the growth rate (depending on the user selection from a dropdown list) by Canadaâ€™s provinces and territories. 

By clicking directly on a particular province or territory or by selecting the desired geography from a dropdown menu, it displays a summary of the top 10 biggest industries (by total GDP), and the yearly and cumulative GDP growth rate of the region. Users can explore different years information by selecting the desired year form a dropdown menu.

* **NOTE:** If possible we would also like to explore adding a feature so users can compare the yearly and cumulative GDP growth rate of different industrues and geographies.
