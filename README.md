# Dashboard for macroeconomic analysis of Canada by provinces/territories

## https://data551lab4-canada-macroeco.herokuapp.com/ 

### Overview

The economy is central to the lives and wellbeing of Canadians. Its trends describe the constantly changing work, business and institutional environment within which people live their daily lives and the shifting array of goods and services that are both produced and consumed by them. Its temporary ups and downs over the course of the economic cycle are closely associated with people's hopes and dejections. 

Our app provides detailed information about some of the main aspects of the economy in Canadaâ€™s national accounts.

### Purpose

* Provide access to accurate, up-to-date macroeconomic data and information for past and current analysis.

* Offer insight into the way the economy works on a large scale, revealing patterns and relationships that affect its efficiency and health. 

### Description 

Our app performs a classical macrocroeconomic analysis broadly focusing on three aspects: national output (measured by **Gross Domestic Product**), **unemployment**, and **inflation** of a selected province or territory of Canada with focus on year of interest.

The most important concept of macroeconomics, refers to the total amount of goods and services a country produces, commonly known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This figure is like a snapshot of the economy at a certain point in time. 

The unemployment rate indicates how many people from the labour force are unable to find work, and the inflation rate is a measure of the rate at which prices rise. 

**In our dashboard, hove over any point of interest for additional details.**
